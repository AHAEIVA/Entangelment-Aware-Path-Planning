This section presents the simulations experimental results of our proposed \ac{REACT} method. The entire framework is implemented in C++ to ensure computational efficiency, and integrated with ROS to facilitate modularity and  deployment on real-world robots. Furthermore, \ac{OMPL} library \cite{ompl} was utilized to compute shortest paths using the RRT* algorithm.  


\subsection{Simulation experimental setup }
The path planner is implemented for a BlueROV2. A \ac{MPC} approach is used to account for model constraints and to provide the optimal control input $\mathbf{u}^{ref} \in \mathbb{R}^4$, where $\mathbf{u}^{ref} = [F_x, F_y, F_z, M_z]^T$ represents the forces in the $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ directions, and the moment about the $Z$-axis. The goal is to follow the desired reference trajectory $\mathbf{x}^{ref} \in \mathbb{R}^6$, where $\mathbf{x}^{ref} = [x_{ref}, y_{ref}, z_{ref}, \psi_{ref}]^T$ contains the reference position ($x_{ref}$, $y_{ref}$, $z_{ref}$) and the reference yaw angle $\psi_{ref}$.

The entanglement-aware path planner provides $\mathbf{x}^{ref}$ in real time, ensuring the BlueROV2 avoids obstacles while following the desired trajectory. For further details about the controller and model, the reader is referred to \cite{amergp}.

%\subsection{Results}
We perform a comparative analysis of the proposed \ac{REACT} method and a baseline conventional \ac{CPP} (FC-Planner \cite{feng2024fc}), which does not contain explicit entanglement handling. 

The simulation setup consists of a pipe structure represented by an underwater pipe model from \cite{feng2024fc}. The simulated onboard camera featured a field of view of 70 degrees. The tether constraint was defined by a maximum allowable tether length of $L_{max}$ = 10.0 meters.

Environmental coverage was evaluated geometrically similar to \cite{amer2023visual}. At each subsampled time step, the position and orientation of the camera were used to determine which triangles in the environment mesh were visible. A triangle was marked as visible if its centroid was within the inspection range, its surface normal faced the camera, and its projection lay within the camera's field of view. Over time, the set of all uniquely observed triangles was accumulated. The coverage at time $t$ was defined as the ratio of the number of unique visible triangles up to time $t$ to the total number of triangles in the environment.


\subsection{Simulations results}

The quantitative performance metrics for both planners are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:performance_metrics}. Figures~\ref{fig:coverage_vs_time} and~\ref{fig:tether_vs_time} visualize the performance of the planners in terms of environmental coverage and tether length, respectively.

The results highlight distinct trade-offs between the two planning strategies. The \ac{CPP}, lacking entanglement awareness, completed the trajectory significantly faster (429.00~s vs. 546.00~s) while achieving marginally less final coverage (99.81\% vs. 99.91\%). However, focusing solely on speed and final coverage overlooks the critical aspect of tether management in constrained environments. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tether_vs_time},\ac{CPP} planner exceeded the $L_{\text{max}}$ constraint during execution. 

\ac{REACT} is explicitly designed to avoid and respond to potential tether entanglement. Its reactive replanning untangles the tether from entangled configurations. 

Conversely, the \ac{CPP}, lacking entanglement- awareness, proceeds along its path violating the maximum tether length constraint. While this happened slightly later in this simulation, the approach risks encountering more severe or unrecoverable tether states without the ability to proactively mitigate them.

The longer execution time of the \ac{REACT} directly is a result of executing reactive replanning maneuvers when necessary. This deliberate approach prioritizes tether safety and mission robustness over raw speed, offering a significant advantage for reliable operation in complex, real-world underwater scenarios where tether integrity is paramount. 

The \ac{CPP}'s coverage speed advantage comes at the cost of ignoring potential tether hazards, making it less suitable for missions where entanglement poses a significant risk. Therefore, \ac{REACT} demonstrates superior performance in the context of safe and robust tethered \ac{ROV} operation, despite the longer completion time observed in this comparison.
