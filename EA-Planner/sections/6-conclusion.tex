\label{sec:conclusion}
% We presented \ac{REACT} a real-time entanglement-aware path planning framework for tethered underwater vehicles for asset inspection tasks. Through comparative simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrated that conventional planners face tether entanglement issues and fail to complete the mission, as they lack the ability to account for tether constraints. In simulation, \ac{REACT} showed superior tether management while maintaining full coverage. The real-world experiments confirmed these findings, where the baseline \ac{CPP} planner achieved only 80.9\% coverage before becoming physically stuck due to tether entanglement, while \ac{REACT} successfully completed the full mission with 95.6\% coverage through adaptive replanning. On the other hand, \ac{REACT} mitigates potential entanglement through reactive replanning, offering a more robust and reliable solution. \ac{REACT} improves mission safety and integrity, making it ideal for tethered vehicles inspection scenarios where entanglement-awareness is critical.


We present \ac{REACT}, a real-time, entanglement-aware path planning framework for tethered underwater vehicles that supports underwater asset inspection tasks. Through comparative simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that conventional planners face tether entanglement issues and fail to complete the mission, as they lack the ability to account for tether constraints. In simulation, \ac{REACT} shows effective tether management while maintaining full coverage, achieving a shorter total mission time (680 s vs. 855 s) despite longer inspection time due to its proactive entanglement avoidance that eliminates the need for extensive post-mission disentanglement. The real-world experiments confirm these findings, where the baseline \ac{CPP} planner achieves only 80.9\% coverage before becoming physically stuck due to tether entanglement, while \ac{REACT} successfully completes the full mission with 95.6\% coverage through adaptive replanning. Additionally, \ac{REACT} mitigates potential entanglement through reactive replanning, offering a more robust and reliable solution. \ac{REACT} improves mission safety and integrity, making it ideal for tethered vehicle inspection scenarios where entanglement-awareness is critical.

% Future work, include a model of the tether in slack sitatuation, to model the free floating behaviour of the tether. 


% Model entgalement with objects with infininsmal thickness such lines.

% Future work is to integrate this model into standard underwater robotics simulators, such as UNav-Sim.
